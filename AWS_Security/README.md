## Included Labs

- Securing VPCs (firewalls, ACLs, and flow logs)
- Using AWS KMS for encryption and key management
- Monitoring and remediation with CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and AWS Config

## Tools and Services Used
AWS S3, IAM, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, KMS, VPC, Network Firewall, Config, Athena

## What I Learned
